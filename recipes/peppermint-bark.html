                <p>*whisper* It doesn't need to be Christmas time to eat it..</p>
                <p>You heard that right! You can make this all year and i wont judge ya C:</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 ounces (339g) white chocolate, <em>coarsely chopped and divided</em></li>
                    <li>6 ounces (170g) semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, <em>coarsely chopped</em></li>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil or coconut oil, <em>divided</em></li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract, <em>divided</em></li>
                    <li>2–3 regular-size candy canes (24–36g total), <em>crushed</em></li>  
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Line the bottom and sides of a 8-inch or 9-inch square baking pan with parchment 
                        paper or aluminum foil, smoothing out any wrinkles. Or use a lined baking sheet. 
                        Set aside. </li>
                    <li>Bottom layer: There are a few ways you can melt the chocolate. You can use a 
                        double boiler over just barely simmering water or you can use the microwave. 
                        The microwave is a little more convenient for most, so my directions are for 
                        a microwave. (If using a double boiler, follow this recipe, but melt the 
                        chocolate layers in your double boiler over simmering water.) Place 6 ounces 
                        of white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a liquid measuring cup. 
                        Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Melt in 20-second increments, stirring vigorously 
                        with a silicone spatula or spoon after each increment, until completely melted 
                        and smooth. White chocolate and chocolate overheat easily, so it’s important 
                        to do this in increments. Once melted, stir in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. 
                        Pour melted white chocolate into the prepared baking pan, and, with an offset 
                        spatula or spoon, spread into a thin smooth layer. (If using a baking sheet, 
                        make it as thin as you’d like… I usually spread it out to about 8×12 inches.) 
                        Place the baking pan in the refrigerator for 10–15 minutes or until almost 
                        completely set. If it sets completely, the bark layers could separate.</li>
                    <li>Middle layer: Place semi-sweet chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a 
                        liquid measuring cup. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Repeat melting, just as you 
                        did with the white chocolate in step 2. Once melted, stir in remaining 1/4 
                        teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour all of the semi-sweet chocolate over the 
                        white chocolate layer and spread it into a smooth layer. Place the baking 
                        pan back in the refrigerator for 10–15 minutes or until almost completely set.</li>
                    <li>Top layer: Place the remaining white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a 
                        liquid measuring cup. Add last 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Repeat melting, just as 
                        you did with the other layers. Pour over the bark layers and spread into a smooth 
                        layer. (This layer will not have peppermint extract.) Sprinkle evenly with crushed 
                        candy canes. To crush, place the unwrapped candy canes in a sealed zipped-top bag 
                        and roll or bang with a rolling pin or meat mallet until crushed.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate the bark until completely set, about 1 hour. Once hardened, remove 
                        from the pan and peel off the foil or parchment. Break or cut into pieces as 
                        large or as small as you want. If your bark chilled in the refrigerator for 
                        longer than 3–4 hours, let it sit at room temperature for 10–15 minutes to slightly 
                        soften before breaking/slicing. (Or else the layers might separate.)</li>  
                    <li>Cover and store leftover bark in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. The bark can 
                        be left at room temperature for a few days in colder months, but it gets a little 
                        soft.</li>
