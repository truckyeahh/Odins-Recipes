                    <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>  
                    <li>3–4 cups chicken stock</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long grain white rice</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning or Creole seasoning</li>  
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, <em>crushed</em></li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                    <li>1 pound raw large shrimp <em>peeled and deveined</em></li>
                    <li>1 cup thinly-sliced okra*</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>
                    <li>optional garnishes: chopped fresh parsley, thinly-sliced green onions, hot sauce</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a stock pot (or a very large, deep sauté pan) over medium-high heat.
                        Add the chicken and sausage and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
                        the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is lightly browned.  Transfer to a clean 
                        plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the stock pot.  Add bell peppers, celery, jalapeño, 
                        onion and garlic. Sauté for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are 
                        softened. </li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, rice, Cajun seasoning, thyme, cayenne, bay leaf, and 
                        stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to 
                        medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is nearly cooked 
                        through, stirring every 5 minutes or so along the way so that the rice does not burn.</li>
                        <li>Add the shrimp, okra, and stir to combine. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, 
                            until the shrimp are cooked through and pink. Stir in the chicken and sausage, and 
                            remove and discard the bay leaf.</li>
                        <li>Taste season the jambalaya with salt, pepper, and additional Cajun seasoning if needed.  
                            (I typically add about 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.)  Remove from heat.</li>
                        <li>Serve warm with your desired garnishes.  Or refrigerate and store in a sealed container
                            for up to 3 days.</li>
                    </ol>
