            <h3>Almond Glaze</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
                <li>2 ounces cream cheese <em>softened</em></li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter <em>melted</em></li>

            <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large mixer 
                    bowl. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120° to 130°F) 
                    on the stove or in the microwave in a heat-safe bowl. Stir into 
                    flour mixture. Stir in 1 egg, almonds, almond extract, and enough 
                    remaining flour to make soft dough.</li>
                <li>Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6
                    to 8 minutes. Cover and allow to rest on floured surface 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Divide dough in half; roll each half to 30-inch rope. Loosely twist
                    ropes together. Place twisted rope on large greased baking sheet; 
                    shape into circle and pinch ends together to seal. Place 5 colored 
                    eggs, evenly spaced, on dough, pressing between ropes in twist. Cover
                    , allow to let rise in warm, place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Beat remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush over dough (don’t brush
                    on the eggs). Bake at 350°F for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown on 
                    top and no longer doughy. Remove from sheet and allow to cool on wire rack.</li>
                <li>While ring is cooling, prepare the glaze. Cream together cream cheese and 
                    butter until smooth. Add almond extract and vanilla and mix well. 
                    Mix in powdered sugar until incorporated. (You can add a little milk to 
                    thin if needed). Drizzle over almond ring and serve.</li>
